    <h3>Delicious, perfect ribeye roast is a recipe every home cook should have in 
        their repertoire – it is simple to prepare, but makes a big impact!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ribeye roast</strong>, about 5 pounds – pat roast dry from any packaging liquid 
            and let roast come to room temperature for best results.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>, for brushing – basting ribeye roast with butter helps 
            herbs and spices stick to meat, helps lock in flavor, and adds fat to develop a crisp, 
            crunchy crust to the outside of meat for a rich and delicious flavor that is hearty and 
            sumptuous.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Minced garlic</strong>, garlic brings an earthy, rich layer of flavor to meat 
            that can enhance meaty flavor and add more dimension to your dish.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Kosher salt</strong>, a high quality salt, preferably one with a crunchy 
            texture that won’t melt into the meat is a lovely addition to ribeye roast crust.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Italian seasonings</strong>, adding layer of flavor from basil, thyme, sage, 
            oregano, rosemary, and coriander give more depth to your meat’s flavor and make it 
            completely irresistible!</li>
    </ul>
